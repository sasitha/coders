                The competition will run for 12 hours and the competitors have to be
                    physically present at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya to
                    participate in the competition.
            </li>
            <li>
               The competition is open for teams comprised of at most three undergraduates
                    from a Sri Lankan University.
            </li>
            <li>
                Universities can have multiple teams and there is no limits to the number of
                    teams compete from a University.
            </li>
            <li>
                The teams must solve and complete problems without others help. It should be
                    noted that the spirit of the competition is for the students who are part of the
                    team to solve problems and not others to help.
            </li>
            <li>

                    The problems will be uploaded to a competition website by the organizing
                    committee (with the help of expert programmers) and the judging will be done
                    by a panel of judges. The general rule of thumb is that the team that solves the
                    maximum number of problems in the minimum amount of time will win the
                    competition.

            </li>
            <li>

                    Teams will be supervised by an academic staff member during the 12-hour
                    programming competition.
